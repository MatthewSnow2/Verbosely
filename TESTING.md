2. **Chrome DevTools Extensions**
3. **Test Skool Communities** (create test accounts if needed)

### Test Data

Create test scenarios with:
- High-quality members (detailed posts, helpful content)
- Suspicious members (repetitive posts, automation patterns)
- Mixed-quality members (variety of post types)
- Edge cases (no posts, malformed data)

### Automated Testing Integration

For continuous integration:

```javascript
// Add to your test pipeline
const runExtensionTests = async () => {
  const tester = new ExtensionTester();
  const results = await tester.runAllTests();
  
  if (results.failed > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Extension tests failed: ${results.failed}/${results.total}`);
  }
  
  return results;
};
```

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

1. **Browser version** and operating system
2. **Extension version** (from manifest.json)
3. **Specific Skool URL** where issue occurs
4. **Console error messages** (with full stack traces)
